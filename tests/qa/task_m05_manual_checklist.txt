TASK-M05 Manual QA Checklist

1) Item-level failure isolation
- In Burp, include at least one malformed/unsupported response and normal responses together in scan scope.
- Run scan and verify scan continues to completion for remaining items.
- Verify status message shows completion summary instead of immediate abort.

2) User status vs developer logs separation
- Trigger a controllable failure case (for example invalid export path or forced parser failure build).
- Verify user-facing status bar shows concise message:
  - Example: "Scan failed." or "Export failed: ..."
- Verify Burp Extender Output/Error contains technical details:
  - Example: "[Endpoint Collector] scan item failed: ..."

3) Representative sample verification
- Run regression command:
  - `./gradlew runTaskM05Regression` (or `.\gradlew.bat runTaskM05Regression` on Windows)
- Verify command exits with `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`.
